                        <p>The world is changing rapidly, and as science students, we are at the forefront of this transformation. Our community should be a place where we can deepen our knowledge in our chosen fields and explore our passionsâ€”those interests that sparked our curiosity as kids.

                        <p>As your General Secretary, my goal is to create an environment where your voice is heard and your ideas matter. I envision a faculty where every student feels supported, inspired, and empowered to pursue their dreams. Together with the other executives, I am committed to laying the foundations for this vision to become a reality.
